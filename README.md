# Object Detection Using ESP32-CAM  

This project implements **object detection** using an ESP32-CAM module. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the ESP32-CAM captures video frames and sends them for processing to identify objects in real-time. The project can use external platforms (like TensorFlow Lite, OpenCV, or a custom-trained model) for object detection.

## ðŸ›  Features  

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Capture frames from the ESP32-CAM and detect objects in real-time.  
- **Edge Processing**: Basic detection models can run on the ESP32-CAM directly using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers.  
- **Streaming**: The ESP32-CAM streams video to a server or client for further processing.  
- **Custom Models**: Integrate pre-trained or custom-trained models for specific object detection tasks.

## ðŸ“‘ Installation and Setup  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-esp32cam.git
cd object-detection-esp32cam
```  

### 2. Install Required Libraries  
Ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Arduino IDE:  
- **esp32cam**  
- **TensorFlowLite_ESP32** (if processing on-device)  
- **WebServer**  
- **WiFi**  

### 3. Configure Wi-Fi Credentials  
Replace the `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASS` with your network credentials in the code:  
```cpp
const char* WIFI_SSID = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SSID";
const char* WIFI_PASS = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PASSWORD";
```  

### 4. Upload the Code  
- Connect your ESP32-CAM to the computer via a USB-to-TTL converter.  
- Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.  
- Upload the code to the ESP32-CAM.

## ðŸ–¥ How It Works  

1. **Frame Capture**:  
   The ESP32-CAM captures video frames using its camera.  

2. **Processing**:  
   - **On-Device**: Use TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers to detect objects directly on the ESP32-CAM.  
   - **Off-Device**: Stream frames to a client (Python, Flask, or OpenCV) for real-time processing.  

3. **Detection Output**:  
   The detected objects are displayed with bounding boxes and labels, either on the web interface or through a Python client.

4. **Streaming**:  
   Video is streamed using MJPEG or served as individual frames to the client.

## ðŸ§° Circuit Diagram  

### ESP32-CAM Pins:  
- **U0R**: Connect to TX of USB-to-TTL converter.  
- **U0T**: Connect to RX of USB-to-TTL converter.  
- **GND**: Connect to GND of USB-to-TTL converter.  
- **VCC**: Connect to 5V of USB-to-TTL converter.  

Ensure GPIO0 is connected to GND while uploading the code. Disconnect GPIO0 from GND after uploading to run the code.

## ðŸš€ Python Client for Object Detection  

A Python script (using OpenCV) can be used to process the frames sent by the ESP32-CAM and perform object detection using a pre-trained model like YOLO, SSD, or MobileNet.  

### Requirements  
Install the following Python libraries:  
```bash  
pip install opencv-python flask requests
```  

### Run the Python Server  
```bash  
python object_detection_server.py  
```  

The server will receive frames from the ESP32-CAM, process them, and display the detected objects.

- Improve frame rate for smoother detection.  
- Add support for edge TPU or Coral for faster inference.  
- Integrate with IoT platforms for real-time alerts.
